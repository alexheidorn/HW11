This is similar to a depth-first search because we go down to the end of a single
branch and then backtrack until the last unexplored path, and then explore to the end 
of that path. We repeat until we explore and output the full tree.

We can also conclude that the numbers to the left of 25 belong to the left side
of the tree because they're all less than 50 (the root).

We can also tell that the numbers from 70 and to the right are on the right side
of the root.

By looking at both sets independently, we can also tell that 25 and 80 are the 
children nodes of the root because they're both the final numbers in each set.

We can also see what the left limits are in each set because they're the lowest values.
In this case, the left limits of each branch are 10 and 60.
